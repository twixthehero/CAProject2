    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>My overall goal with this project was to create a new digital musical instrument. My
    original design was to create a graph for the composer to use. The X axis of the graph
    would align to the tempo of a note while the Y axis of the graph would align to the pitch
    f the played notes. The composer can click on the canvas to place a note (called a "Spot") which
    holds a pattern that would be repeatted ever one musical measure. This spot can then be dragged
    around and would update it's pitch/tempo based on it's position. This would allow for dynamically
    changing the note while it/they are currently playing.</p>
    <p>The user can place/delete spots from the screen by clicking and using the delete checkbox.
    Pitch for each spot changes live when it is dragged around. Each spot's color and radius can be
    changed. The tempo axis was never implemented due to issues (see below) with Tone.js.</p>
    <h3>Issues</h3>
    <p>
    Tone.js does not handle musical rests, so I wrote my own notation based on theirs that
    would parse the pattern, then calculate the correct timestamps for additional notes in the
    pattern after a rest. For example, the pattern 8n8n8r8n would end up as an array
    <ul>
    <li>[["0:0", <frequency>],</li>
    <li>["0:0:2", <frequency>],</li>
    <li>["0:1:0", <frequency>],</li>
    <li>["0:1:2", <frequency>]]</li>
    </ul>
    for use in the SimpleSynth.
    </p>
    <p>After working with Tone.js for syncing music patterns, I encountered a big issue with my
    code framework where the very first note of a pattern was never played. After hours of testing,
    I was unable to figure out why it ended up this way. Upon creating a test project, it worked
    as intended, but I was unable to replicate the same functionality in the full project.</p>
